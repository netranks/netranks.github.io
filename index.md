## What is NetRanks?

[NetRanks](https://netranks.ai) reverse-engineers how AI engines (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity) decide what to cite — and tells you exactly how to get cited.

**We don't just track your AI visibility. We show you how to win it.**

### The Problem

AI search is replacing traditional search. When users ask ChatGPT *"what's the best CRM?"*, your SEO rankings don't matter — only what the AI decides to cite. Most companies have no idea if they're visible in AI responses, or how to improve.

### What NetRanks Does

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **AI Visibility Tracking** | See how often you're cited across ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity |
| **Reverse-Engineering Models** | Proprietary ML that decodes what makes AI cite a source |
| **Prescriptive Roadmaps** | Not dashboards — actionable content recommendations |
| **Industry-Specific** | Tailored insights by vertical and language |

### Why NetRanks?

- **Prescriptive, not descriptive** — We tell you what to fix, not just what's broken
- **Built by search experts** — Team from eBay, Booking.com, Google, Omnicom, Publicis

> *"NetRanks doesn't just track AI visibility — it reverse-engineers how to win it."*
