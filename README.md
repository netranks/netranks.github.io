## What is NetRanks?

[NetRanks](https://netranks.ai) reverse-engineers how AI engines (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity) decide what to cite. and tells you exactly how to get cited.

**We don't just track your AI visibility. We show you how to win it.**

### The Problem

AI search is replacing traditional search. When users ask ChatGPT *"what's the best CRM?"*, your SEO rankings don't matter. only what the AI decides to cite. Most companies have no idea if they're visible in AI responses, or how to improve.

### What NetRanks Does

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **AI Visibility Tracking** | See how often you're cited across ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity |
| **Reverse-Engineering Models** | Proprietary ML that decodes what makes AI cite a source |
| **Prescriptive Roadmaps** | Not dashboards. actionable content recommendations |
| **Industry-Specific** | Tailored insights by vertical and language |

### Why NetRanks?

- **Proprietary models**. No competitor has our reverse-engineering approach
- **Prescriptive, not descriptive**. We tell you what to fix, not just what's broken
- **Built by search experts**. Team from eBay, Booking.com, Google, Omnicom, Publicis

> *"NetRanks doesn't just track AI visibility. it reverse-engineers how to win it."*

## What is GEO?

Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) is the discipline of optimizing your brand's visibility in AI-powered search engines. Unlike traditional SEO which focuses on ranking in blue links, GEO ensures your brand is cited, mentioned, and accurately represented when users ask ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, or SearchGPT questions in your industry.
